# Artistic Vision Transfer

Artistic Vision Transfer is a web application that transforms your photos into stunning artworks using neural style transfer techniques. This project leverages Flask for the web framework and TensorFlow for the style transfer model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide users with an easy-to-use interface to apply artistic styles to their images. Users can upload a content image and a style image, and the application will generate a new image that combines the content of the first with the style of the second.

## Features

- **Neural Style Transfer:** Apply artistic styles to images using pre-trained models.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Bootstrap for a clean and responsive design.
- **Loading Animation:** Displays a loading animation while processing images.
- **Dynamic Image Display:** Shows the transformed image directly on the webpage.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.
- **TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub:** For implementing neural style transfer.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive and modern UI design.
- **JavaScript:** For handling form submissions and displaying results dynamically.
